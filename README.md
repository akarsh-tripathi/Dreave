## Problem Statment : Addressing the after-effects

- There are between 5 000 and 8 000 rare diseases, most of them with a genetic basis

- A very rough estimate would be that one out of 15 persons worldwide could be affected by a rare (“orphan”) disease – 400 million people worldwide, of whom 30 million are in Europe and 25 million in the United States.

- Rare diseases are serious chronic diseases, and may be life-threatening.

- People suffering through these rare diseases always feel left out from the rest of the world and always face a number of problems throughout their life.


## Our Solution

- We want to help in building a more inclusive society worldwide, and for doing so, we have taken up the cause of those affected by extremely rare and unfortunate diseases throughout the world. Diseases of which perhaps even the most accomplished of doctors might have heard only vaguely. To be isolated for reasons that one has no or little control over and to not be able to seek out proper medical help due to lack of awareness, are things that unfortunately plague millions of people worldwide. We want to put in our contribution, however small to help curb this divide of medical resources and knowledge.

- Through **Dreave**, we plan to build a global community of those affected by extremely rare diseases. While doing so, we are trying to address 2 major goals- that of overcoming emotional and mental stresses of discovering one’s condition and going through with the strenuous medico-legal procedures required in such cases, and that of connecting people with the same diseases so they might share and provide each other with knowledge of the expected procedures and reliable information on who to approach and how to approach for relevant professional help along with answering the various whose and how’s that come along the way. Another crucial feature of this application is that apart from connecting the patients and their families with each other, we are also striving hard to connect them all to highly accomplished and renowned doctors who are experienced to tackle such cases with precision and care, for even better and more reliable help.
